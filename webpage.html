    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>The world is beatiful. There are some days when it's rainy or even stormy but we know after a rainy day a sunny day will come. 
        It's required to have both because when the two combines a rainbow appears, but it wouldn't without the sun or the rain.
        It only works if both of them show up at the same time.
